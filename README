This is an attempt to implement a dynamic formatting system
for C++. It is different from boost.format approach because
it uses named parameters and places formatting options in
the format string instead than in the calling code.

For example the format string "%08/2{x}" formats the field
named 'x' using 8 binary digits with leading zeros.

There is also provision for sequence formatting:

    std::cout << Format("[0x%02x*/, {v}]") %
                 FormatDict()("v", sequence(v.begin(), v.end()));

can generate as output

    [0x01, 0x02, 0x03, 0x04, 0x05]
